## Installation
This is where you put specific instructions on how to install the application if there are any installation steps. This would include installation requirements such as node or to run npm init/install.
    
## Usage
This is where you outline how the user uses the application. This is required and designed to walk the user through the use process.

## Credits
This any resources and collaborators here. This is a bit ugly not as a list style; however, if I tell the user to use markdown test to create a list or breakpoints it might look better. <br> This should be on a new line. <br>- This should be a list item. <br> - This should be another list item.

## Features
This is where I can continue to add different features. In this case, I will test the markdown abilities: <br> 1. List Item 1 <br> 2. List Item 2 <br> ```this should be a box snip``` <br> `this should be block`
