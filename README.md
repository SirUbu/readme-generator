## Features
You are able to write markdown text to get a clean and polished READEME even from the terminal! <br><br> Use `<br>` to crete a line break. <br><br> Using [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as a guide, created different outputs: <br><br> 1. Lists <br> 2. *Italic Text* <br> 3. **Bold Text** <br><br> Inline `code lines` <br> and even syntax highlighting <br> ````Write your syntax or code bits here!```` <br><br> Here's a tip for some of the sections: <br><br> - Screenshot: The screenshot link is already being generated, you only need to add the name of the file you're adding such as `screenshot.PNG`. The README.md will look for this file in the `assets/images` directory so be sure to have one. For this example, if you entered `screenshot.PNG`, the README.md link will be `./assets/images/screenshot.PNG`. <br><br> - Link: You need to enter the complete address of the link you are wanting. This could be to a deployed page, or even a video walkthrough!<br>
